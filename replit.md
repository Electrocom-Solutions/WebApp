## Development
- **Dev Server**: `npm run dev` (runs on port 5000)
- **Build**: `npm run build`
- **Start Production**: `npm start`

## Design Tokens
- **Theme**: Dark mode is default
- **Primary Accent**: sky-500 (for interactive elements, buttons, links)
- **Card Style**: 
  - Light: White background with `rounded-lg border border-gray-200 shadow-sm`, hover effect with `hover:shadow-md`
  - Dark: `dark:bg-gray-800 dark:border-gray-700` with `dark:hover:shadow-md`
- **Icon Containers**: 
  - Light: `bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200` with `text-gray-500`
  - Dark: `dark:bg-gray-700 dark:border-gray-700` with `dark:text-gray-400`
- **Category Badges**: 
  - Light: `bg-gray-100 text-gray-700`
  - Dark: `dark:bg-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300`
- **Background**: 
  - Light: white cards on gray background
  - Dark: gray-800 cards on gray-900 background (default)
- **Typography**: System fonts with clear hierarchy, use `dark:text-white` and `dark:text-gray-400` variants
- **Color Philosophy**: Clean, minimal aesthetic with proper dark theme support across all components. All new pages MUST include dark theme variants using Tailwind's dark: prefix

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Dark Theme Default
The dark theme is applied as default through a multi-layered approach to prevent hydration mismatches:
1. **Static SSR**: HTML element has `className="dark"` for server-side rendering
2. **Pre-hydration Script**: Inline script in layout reads localStorage and applies theme class before React hydrates
3. **Theme Provider**: Client-side provider defaults to "dark" and synchronizes with localStorage
4. **No Flash**: Users never see a light theme flash when loading the app

This implementation eliminates hydration errors and ensures consistent dark mode across page loads.

## Notes
- All forms and data structures match the provided database schema
- Frontend uses mock data and is ready for Django API integration
- Theme preference persists in localStorage
- Mobile navigation collapses sidebar to icons
