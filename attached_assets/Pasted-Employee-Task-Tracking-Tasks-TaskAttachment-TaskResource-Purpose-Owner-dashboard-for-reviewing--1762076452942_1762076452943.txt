Employee Task Tracking (Tasks, TaskAttachment, TaskResource)
Purpose
Owner dashboard for reviewing, editing, assigning and approving field tasks submitted by employees. Provide fast, actionable summaries (day/week/month), let owner enter UNIT_COST for resources used, create tasks for staff, and export or act on task evidence (attachments).
CORE FEATURES (Owner actions)
Task Inbox
See all tasks submitted by employees(new tasks highlighted).
Quick filters: Today / This Week / This Month / Custom Date Range.
Search by employee, client, project, location, or task ID.
Summaries & Analytics
Summary cards for selected period: Total Tasks, Completed, Pending, Total Time (hrs), Total Resource Cost (est.).
Charts: tasks by status, tasks per employee, time logged over time.
Export summary as CSV / PDF.
Task List & Drilldown
Compact list/table of tasks with key columns: Date, Employee, Client/Project, Location, Short Description, Time (mins), Status, Resource Cost (computed).
Row actions: View, Edit, Assign/Reassign, Approve, Reject, Export Task (PDF).
Inline expand to show attachments and resource lines.
Edit Task (Owner)
Full edit slide-over/modal enabling owner to:
Update Status (Open, In Progress, Completed, Approved, Rejected).

Edit Resources used: for each resource line owner can enter UNIT_COST (owner-entered), update quantity, and the UI recalculates TOTAL_COST = UNIT_COST * QUANTITY.

Owner can create a new task and assign it to any employee:
Fields: Client, Project, Location, Date, Description, Estimated Time, Resources (name + qty), Attachments, Priority.
Assign/Reassign existing tasks to different employees via a quick action (dropdown with search).
Bulk Actions
Select multiple tasks to mark as Approved, Export, Assign, or Add internal note.
Notifications
Alerts for new tasks, tasks pending approval over X days, tasks with missing unit costs, and high-cost resource usage.
